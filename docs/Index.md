I am a graduate student interested in the evolutionary ecology of reptiles and amphibians in tropical rainforests. My undergradute research 
  was on the population structure and genetic diversity of the endemic and endangered Rough-nosed horned lizard of Sri Lanka. 
  My current M.S. thesis work explored the neurological basis of mate choice in the highly variable Red-eyed Treefrog of Costa Rica.
