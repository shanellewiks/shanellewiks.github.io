I am broadly interested in evolutionary ecology and conservation in tropical rainforests. My current research examines the impacts of habitat fragmentation and climate change on the persistence of tropical ectotherms, with a focus on Sri Lankan agamid lizards.
I did my M.S. in the [Robertson lab](https://jrobertsonlab.wordpress.com/) at California State University, Northridge, where I studied the of role of female mate choice in mediating premating behavioural reproductive isolation along the speciation continuum of the Red-eyed treefrog (_Agalychnis callidryas_).
My undergraduate [research](https://doi.org/10.1111/btp.12970) in the [Leach√© lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/leache/wordpress/) focused on the population genetics of the endangered and endemic Sri Lankan Rough-nosed horned lizard (_Ceratophora aspera_).
