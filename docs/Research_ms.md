Theory predicts that sexual selection via mate choice can be a primary driver of reproductive isolation when lineages exhibit divergence in sexual traits, there is variation in preference for those signals, and there is little/no evidence that ecological selection mediates trait divergence. 
The red-eyed treefrog (RETF; _Agalychnis callidryas_), displays high levels of phenotypic variation for multiple sexual traits, including body size, colour pattern, advertisement call, and female courtship behaviour. 
We addressed the role of female mate choice as a mechanism of sexual selection by testing its contributions along a speciation continuum. We estimated reproductive isolation as a function of mate recognition and mate preference in female RETFs using mate choice trials and tested their relationship against a species continuum of genetic distance.
This project was part of my M.S. thesis research in the [Robertson lab](https://jrobertsonlab.wordpress.com/) at California State University, Northridge.
