# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a graduate student interested in the evolutionary ecology of reptiles and amphibians in tropical rainforests. My undergradute research 
  was on the population structure and genetic diversity of the endemic and endangered Rough-nosed horned lizard of Sri Lanka. 
  My current M.S. thesis work explored the neurological basis of mate choice in the highly variable Red-eyed Treefrog of Costa Rica.
