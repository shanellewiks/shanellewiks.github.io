I am very lucky to have grown up with a home garden. 
My home garden was one of the first places that got me interested in the natural world. 
I grew up around Hourglass treefrogs (Polypydates cruciger), Green garden lizards (Calotes calotes), and many other small but wonderful creatures. 
Here are some of them. 

 
## Insects

## Dragonflies

## Spiders


## Water monitors (_Varanus salvator_)



## Birds
