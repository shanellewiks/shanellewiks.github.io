I am an M.S. student in the Robertson lab at California State University, Northridge. 
I am broadly interested in evolutionary ecology of reptiles and amphibians in tropical rainforests. 
My undergraduate research focused on the population genetics of the endangered and endemic Sri Lankan Rough-nosed horned lizard (_Ceratophora aspera_). 
My M.S. thesis uses neurological techniques to understand how female mate-choice affects speciation in the highly variable Red-eyed treefrog (_Agalychnis callidryas_).
