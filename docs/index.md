I am a PhD student in the [Funk Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/funklab/home?authuser=0) at Colorado State University, Fort Collins. 
I am broadly interested in evolutionary ecology of reptiles and amphibians in tropical rainforests. My current research focuses on the impacts of habitat fragmentation and climate change on the persistence of tropical ectotherms. 

I did my M.S. in the [Robertson lab](https://jrobertsonlab.wordpress.com/) at California State University, Northridge, where I studied the of role of female mate choice in mediating premating behavioural reproductive isolation along the speciation continuum of the Red-eyed treefrog (_Agalychnis callidryas_).

My undergraduate [research](https://doi.org/10.1111/btp.12970) in the [Leach√© lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/leache/wordpress/) focused on the population genetics of the endangered and endemic Sri Lankan Rough-nosed horned lizard (_Ceratophora aspera_).
